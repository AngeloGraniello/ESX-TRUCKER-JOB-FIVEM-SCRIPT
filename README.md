# THE BEST PIZZA SCRIPT JOB FOR FIVEM 

_This script will help you to copy different coordinate formats with a simple and beautiful system._

## Starting 🚀

_This is the main script of the best pizza job for fivem, remember to install the dependency._


### Requirements 📋

_requirements you need for it to work properly_

```
pizza_job_req_gianluigi
interact-sound
rprogress
mythic_notify
dpemotes
```

### Installation 🔧

```
1 - add the script to your resource folder
```

```
2 -  write in your server.cfg the name of the folder pizza_job_gianluigi
```

```
3 -  Modify the config.lua file

6 - Install all the necessary items for the script to work, you can see it in the config,lua or in the server.lua. I have not placed a .sql file because currently the inventories work with metadata but that is another topic.

### Important 📋

```
1 -  Sorry if the variables on the client side are a bit confusing, I also want to apologize if the code is a bit messy, but in principle I did not plan to release this code to github. I will be working to re-create the code in a better way.
